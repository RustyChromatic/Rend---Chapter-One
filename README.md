# What is REND?
Rend is a fast-paced action shooter inspired by games such as DOOM, Quake, Ultrakill, and many more.
Based off, but overly dramatized events of the developer and some of his friends going on a roadtrip across america, are met with the sight of EVIL and MURDEROUS robotics built the
right-wing goverment to stop any and all "woke" propaganda. (this is not the ACTUAL story but its funny as fuck)
(yes this is a mainly left wing game, gay people and trans people are awesome)

# Can we make custom content for REND?
Yes! Rend's code is fully open source, meaning anyone can mod the game to thier hearts content (but dont steal ANY code, thats bad.)
If you're looking for something simple like creating a custom map, REND utilizes a Godot plugin that can import TRENCHBROOM maps incredibly easily.
